Before the advent of mechanical computers, there were human computers who used to carry out computational tasks. By the invention of computing machines, these human computers were replaced by machines ! Since then machines have been continuously improving. 

Machines do not understand human language. They only understand electronics signals as 0 and 1. So every command to be executed on the input to return the output must be of the combination of 0s and 1s. So to simply this task compilers and interpreters were introduced that convert the human language to binary code which the machine executes. The binary code is also called the machine language. The compiler coverts the entire code to binary code at once, while the interpreter goes line by line.

Now we are stepping into the era of thinking machines ! Machines that learn from given data over a period of time and alter their algorithms accordingly.

But amidst all these I have found Vignesh Moovendhan. He is the real version of Nanban movie Parivendhan. As a guide he showered me with resources to learn from. So I have started my A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) journey by first learning python. I learnt that python has many pakages and modules,which can be inbuild or external. These pakages help developers to make use of code already written. This greatly saves time, allowing developers focus on real issues.

So machine learning model use a neural network.
